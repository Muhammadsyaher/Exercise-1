# Exercise 1

Discussion
1.  The importance of scripting in 3D graphics: The exercise demonstrates how scripting can be used to create complex 3D models with a high degree of control and         flexibility. Scripting allows us to automate repetitive tasks, experiment with different parameters and settings, and create variations of models quickly and efficiently.
2. The role of parameters in 3D modeling: The exercise shows how different parameters can be used to control the dimensions, location, and rotation of 3D models. By tweaking these parameters, we can create models with different shapes, sizes, and orientations. The use of ranges for these parameters allows us to create models with some degree of unpredictability and variation.
3. Applications of 3D graphics and scripting: 3D graphics and scripting have a wide range of applications in various fields, such as gaming, animation, visual effects, architecture, engineering, and education. By mastering these tools and techniques, we can create compelling and interactive 3D experiences that engage and inform audiences.


The exercise demonstrates the power and potential of using scripting to create 3D models as well as the challenges and opportunities of creating more complex scenes with conveyor systems.
